Dear Dr. {{{StateVetLName}}}:

The certificate number {{{CVINumber}}} is marked "Not Approved" for the following reason(s):

.list.{{{Errors}}}

It is the responsibility of the licensed and accredited veterinarian who issues the interstate health certificate to insure that the requirements of the state of destination have been met.  
.b.We are providing this information for you to take whatever action you feel is appropriate.  

Note: If the reason list includes "Certificate out of date" the logic applied was that the ADT rule allows 5 working days from the issuing veterinarian to the origin state veterinarian and another five working days to forward to the destination state veterinarian.  To allow a margin of error, at this time we only mark these "out of date" if received 30 days or more after issuance.
