Civet is a tool that we in the South Carolina State Veterinarian's office have found useful.  We make it freely available to any other animal health authority in hopes that it will promote greater data interoperability, especially around animal disease traceability.  The only thing we ask in return is that you keep us informed of your use so that we can properly plan any enhancements and bug-fixes.  At least semi-annually please send your Civet version number, the number of instances of Civet you are running in test and production, and any unusually details of your application to mmarti5@clemson.edu.

Starting with Civet5 by using this software you agree that your agency will devote a significant effort to promotion of real electronic Certificates of Veterinary Inspection.  Civet is not supposed to be a permanent solution.
